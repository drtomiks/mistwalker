Basic Grails 3 web app intended to serve as a dashboard to a remote database. (A little Grails 3 learning project.)

Nothing fancy here. This web app is intended to run locally on the embedded desktop server and serve as a dashboard
to selected tables on a local or remote database.

While this may eventually grow up into something to help me with my day to day work, it's mostly intended to help me
learn to use Grails 3. ^_^
